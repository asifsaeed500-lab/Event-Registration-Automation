# Event-Registration-Automation
I’ve built a complete Event Registration Confirmation system that captures data from a Google Form, generates a unique Registration ID and QR code for each participant, stores all records in Google Sheets and Drive, and sends a confirmation email. This makes check-in fast and builds attendance data for future marketing.
